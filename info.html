    <p class="bio">Being a small boy I was fortunate to witness nature with the eyes of an unschooled child. Playing with friends, fishing, hiking in the mountains
I was soaking up environment without even realising it. This was the most important stage of my becoming.</p>

<p class="bio">Later on I studied art at the Art College in Sukhumi. But the core of my artistic vision was already safely sealed off deep in my mind. Please don`t get me wrong.
One should never unsderestimate the importance of formal education. But I strongly believe that what makes us unique cannot be found in a classroom. So I went outside and practised plein-air painting.
The routine was to get up at 5 AM, take my old and trusty field easel and go outside looking for a motive to paint. 3 hours later I was back with a small piece. If I was persistent enough these steps were repeated at the evening.
2 years later (1991-1992) I accumulated a solid collection of works. Some of them were good enough to be framed.</p>

<p class="bio">All this ended in August of 1992. Our family moved to our relatives in Russia for a couple of weeks. Who knew that it will be forever.
The civil war in Georgia in 1992-1993 made it impossible for us to return.</p>

<p class="bio">When someone asks me where do I find inspiration, where do my images come from I simply say it is everywhere. It is not about a place or source.
It is all about that core transforming everyday life into artistic statement.</p>
